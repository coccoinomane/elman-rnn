Numpy-only implementations of the Recurrent Neural Networks from the groundbreaking paper "[Finding Structure in Time](./paper/1990%20Elman%20-%20Finding%20Structure%20in%20Time%20(RNN).pdf)" by Jeffrey Elman (1990), the godfather of RNNs.  All scripts are written using an educational approach, with comments and explanations.

# Networks Implemented

Here are the relevant scripts:

- XOR example from the **EXCLUSIVE-OR** section of the paper: **[scripts/xor.py](./scripts/xor.py)**
- Next-letter example from the **STRUCTURE IN LETTER SEQUENCES** section: **[scripts/letter.py](./scripts/letters.py)**
- Word-play example from the **DISCOVERING THE NOTION "WORD"** section: *to be done*
