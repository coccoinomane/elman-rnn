A collection of Recurrent Neural Networks from the groundbreaking paper "[Finding Structure in Time](./paper/1990%20Elman%20-%20Finding%20Structure%20in%20Time%20(RNN).pdf)" by Jeffrey Elman (1990), the godfather of RNNs.

So far, I have implemented the RNN from the **EXCLUSIVE OR** section, to predict the next bit in a XOR sequence.  You can find it here:

- **[scripts/xor.py](./scripts/xor.py)**

The next step is to implement the RNN described in the **STRUCTURE IN LETTER SEQUENCES**, to predict the next letter in a sequence of letters, differentiating between consonants and vowels.

Finally, I will tackle the next-word prediction task, as featured in the remaining sections of the paper.
